# WIZnet-PICO-v6-FREERTOS-C Project

This project is a simple example of OpenSSL communication using the W6100-EVB-PICO, W6100-EVB-PICO2 and **W6300-EVB-PICO2** board, which combines the **RP2350** microcontroller and the **W6300** chip from WIZnet.  
The implementation is based on **Pico-SDK, FreeRTOS, MbedTLS, and io6Library** for WIZnet communication.

This example demonstrates how to establish secure communication over Ethernet using OpenSSL and the W6300 chip.  
By following the instructions below, you can successfully build and run this project on your W6300-EVB-PICO2 board.

## üìå **Key Features**
- **Microcontroller:** RP2040 (ARM Cortex-M0), RP2350 (ARM Cortex-M33)  
- **Ethernet Chip:** W6100, W6300 (WIZnet)  
- **RTOS:** FreeRTOS  
- **Libraries Used:**
  - **Pico-SDK:** RP2350 SDK for peripheral and hardware control.  
  - **FreeRTOS:** Real-Time Operating System for task management.  
  - **MbedTLS:** For secure communication (SSL/TLS).  
  - **io6Library:** For WIZnet Ethernet communication.  
- **Example Functionality:** Simple OpenSSL communication over Ethernet.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notices for Building the Project**
To successfully build the project, you need to modify a line in the `port.c` file of the FreeRTOS Kernel **and adjust the CMakeLists.txt file**:

- **File:** `WIZnet-PICO-v6-FREERTOS-C\libraries\FreeRTOS-Kernel\portable\ThirdParty\GCC\RP2040\port.c`  
- **Line:** **414**  
- **Original Code:**
  ```c
  uint32_t irq_num = SIO_IRQ_PROC0 + get_core_num();
  ```
- **Modified Code:**
  ```c
  uint32_t irq_num = 15 + get_core_num();
  ```
- **Reason:** This modification is required for compatibility with the RP2350 architecture to ensure successful compilation.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **CMakeLists.txt Configuration**
To select the appropriate board, you need to uncomment one of the following lines in your `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```cmake
# Set board
# set(BOARD_NAME W6100_EVB_PICO)
# set(BOARD_NAME W6100_EVB_PICO2)
set(BOARD_NAME W6300_EVB_PICO2)
```

Only **one** of these lines should be uncommented at a time to ensure that the correct board is selected.

Additionally, ensure that the Ethernet chip setting is correct:

```cmake
if(${BOARD_NAME} STREQUAL W6100_EVB_PICO)
    set(WIZNET_CHIP W6100)
    add_definitions(-D_WIZCHIP_=W6100)
elseif(${BOARD_NAME} STREQUAL W6100_EVB_PICO2)
    set(PICO_PLATFORM rp2350)
    set(WIZNET_CHIP W6100)
    add_definitions(-D_WIZCHIP_=W6100)
elseif(${BOARD_NAME} STREQUAL W6300_EVB_PICO2)
    set(PICO_PLATFORM rp2350)
    set(WIZNET_CHIP W6300)
    add_definitions(-D_WIZCHIP_=W6300)
```

Make sure that the settings match your hardware configuration to avoid build errors.
